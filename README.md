# Calculating actual vehicle revenue miles & hours

The app is basically analyzing *two separate files* to check over each other and generate a text document probe check report. 
The **purpose** of developing this app is to target which fixed route buses are not probed and which dates are their last time probing.



## File Format

This project is used by the following file formats:

- **seperate 10 .xlsx files**, which is extracted from *LeeTran NTD Workbook*


## Deployment

To deploy this project run, the following modules are needed to be imported as belows.

```bash
import os
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import datetime
from datetime import date, timedelta
```

To convert .py into .exe, copy the following command onto your Anaconda Prompt
```bash
auto-py-to-exe
```



## Repository Structure

#### Update key notes:


- (1) only pick up 3-digit Bus number
- (2) remove text in stand-by list 
- (3) remove '/' and ' / " from stand_by_list
